Check if libespeak is installed: Ensure that the libespeak library is installed on your system. You may need to install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it using sudo apt-get install libespeak1.

# On Windows O.S
For Windows, instead of using sudo apt-get install libespeak1 which is a command for installing packages on Debian-based Linux distributions, you can install eSpeak directly from the eSpeak website or using package managers specifically for Windows. Once downloaded, you can run the installer and follow the installation instructions provided. This will install eSpeak on your Windows system. After installing eSpeak, you'll need to make sure it's accessible to your Python environment. If you're using a virtual environment, you may need to activate it before installing Python packages.

You can then install the pyttsx3 library, which is a Python library that provides a simple interface to text-to-speech engines.
